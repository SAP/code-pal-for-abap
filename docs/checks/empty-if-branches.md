## Empty IF Branches Check

### What is the Intent of the Check?

The Empty IF Branches check searches for empty `IF` statements and empty `IF` branches.

### Which attributes can be maintained?

![Attributes](./imgs/empty_if_branch.png)

### How to solve the issue?

Fill the `IF` branch with code, remove it from the code or refactor the condition.

### What to do in case of exception?

You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC EMPTY_IF_BRANCH`. The pseudo comment has to be placed after the opening statement of the empty `IF` branch. In case of nested `IF`statements, the deepest within the branch.

```abap
IF name = ''.
  IF address = ''. "#EC EMPTY_IF_BRANCH

  ENDIF.
ENDIF.

IF name = ''. "#EC EMPTY_IF_BRANCH

ENDIF.

IF name = ''.
  " Source Code.
ELSEIF name = ''. "#EC EMPTY_IF_BRANCH

ELSE.
  " Source Code.
ENDIF.

IF name = ''.
  " Source Code.
ELSE. "#EC EMPTY_IF_BRANCH

ENDIF.
```
