## TEST-SEAM Statement Usage Check

### What is the Intent of the Check?

This check searches for the usage of the ABAP statement: TEST-SEAM. 
Test seams are invasive and tend to get entangled in private dependencies, such that they are hard to keep alive and stable in the long run.

### How does the check work?

This check searches for usage of the `TEST-SEAM` statement.

## How to solve the issue?

`TEST-SEAM` shall not be used.

### What to do in case of exception?

In exceptional cases, you can suppress this finding by using the pseudo comment `"#EC TEST_SEAM_USAGE` which should be placed right after the declaration.

### Example

```abap
TEST-SEAM seam_name.    "#EC TEST_SEAM_USAGE
```
