## Equals Sign Chaining

### What is the Intent of the Check?

This check identifies sequenced assignments as they usually confuse the reader.

```abap
"anti-pattern
x = y = z
```

### How to solve the issue?

Break it in multiple rows:
```abap
y = z.
x = y.
```

Alternatively, you can use the `xsdbool` if the target is a comparison:

```abap
x = xsdbool( y = z ).
```

### What to do in case of exception?

In exceptional cases, you can suppress this finding by using the pseudo-comment `"#EC EQUALS_CHAINING` which should be placed after the attribution:

```abap
x = y = z.        "#EC EQUALS_CHAINING
```
