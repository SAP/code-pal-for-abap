## Equals Sign Chaining

### What is the Intent of the Check?

The Equals Sign Chaining Check highlights when someone confuses the assignment of a variable with a condition.

### How does the check work?

The check searches for chained assignments of variables.

```abap
DATA x TYPE bool,
     y TYPE bool,
     z TYPE bool.
x = abap_false.
y = abap_false.
z = abap_true.
x = y = z.
```

### How to solve the issue?

Use `xsdbool( conditions )` to allocate the result of conditions into a variable.

```abap
DATA x TYPE bool,
     y TYPE bool,
     z TYPE bool.
x = abap_false.
y = abap_false.
z = abap_true.
x = xsdbool( y = abap_false AND
             z = abap_true ).
```

### What to do in case of exception?

You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC EQUALS_CHAINING`.

```abap
DATA x TYPE bool,
     y TYPE bool,
     z TYPE bool.
x = abap_false.
y = abap_false.
z = abap_true.
x = y = z.        "#EC EQUALS_CHAINING
```
