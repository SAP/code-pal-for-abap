# Empty Catch
## What is the Intent of the Check?
The Empty Catch check searches for empty `CATCH` blocks.

## How to solve the issue?
Fill the `CATCH` block with an exception handling.

## What to do in case of exception?
You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC EMPTY_CATCH`. The pseudo comment has to be placed after the opening statement of the empty `CATCH`.

### Example
```abap
TRY.
"some code
CATCH cx_error. "#EC EMPTY_CATCH
ENDTRY.

CATCH SYSTEM-EXCEPTIONS. "#EC EMPTY_CATCH
ENDCATCH.
```
