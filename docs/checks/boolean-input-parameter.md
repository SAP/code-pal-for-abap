## Boolean Input Parameter

### What is the Intent of the Check?

Usage of boolean input parameters because they are often an indicator that a method does two things instead of one.  
Ps: Setter methods using boolean variables are ok.

### How to solve the issue?

Splitting the method may simplify the methods' code and describe the different intentions better.

### What to do in case of exception?

You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC BOOL_PARAM`.  
The pseudo comment has to be placed after the method declaration.

```abap
  METHODS update IMPORTING do_save TYPE abap_bool. "#EC BOOL_PARAM
```

### Example

Before the check:

```abap
  METHODS update IMPORTING do_save TYPE abap_bool.
```

After the check:

```abap
  METHODS update_without_saving.
  METHODS update_and_save.
```
