## Non-Class Exception Check Usage

### What is the Intent of the Check?

This check searches for non-class based execeptions raised in your code. 

### How does the check work?

It search for non class-based exceptions like:

* `RAISE SYSTEM-EXCEPTIONS`
* `RAISE` ( without `EXCEPTION` or `RESUMABLE EXCEPTION` )
* `MESSAGE with RAISING`

### How to solve the issue?

The solution is to use class-base exceptions like:

* `RAISE EXCEPTION`
* `RAISE RESUMABLE EXCEPTION`
* `RAISE SHORTDUMP`
* `THROW` ( in conditions )

### What to do in case of exception?

In exceptional cases, you can suppress this finding by using the pseudo comment `â€œ#EC NON_CL_EXCEPT`:

```abap
RAISE SYSTEM-EXCEPTIONS.  "#EC NON_CL_EXCEPT

RAISE ex_name. "#EC NON_CL_EXCEPT

MESSAGE msg_name RAISING ex_name. "#EC NON_CL_EXCEPT
```
