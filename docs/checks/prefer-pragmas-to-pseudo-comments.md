## Prefer Pragmas to Pseudo Comments

### What is the Intent of the Check?

Based on the [Clean ABAP](https://github.com/SAP/styleguides/blob/main/clean-abap/CleanABAP.md#prefer-pragmas-to-pseudo-comments):
> Prefer pragmas to pseudo comments to suppress irrelevant warnings and errors identified by the ATC. Pseudo comments have mostly become obsolete and have been replaced by pragmas

:bulb: Only the Pseudo Comments and Pragmas available in the `SLIN_DESC` table are in scope.

:wan: Code Pal does not support Pragmas.

### How to solve the issue?

Change the `"#EC ` (Pseudo Comment) to `##` (Pragma).

### What to do in case of exception?

This Check cannot be exempt.

### Example

Before the check:

```abap
  DATA a TYPE string.   "#EC NEEDED
```

After the check:

```abap
  DATA a TYPE string.   ##NEEDED
```
