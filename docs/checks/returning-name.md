## Returning Name

### What is the Intent of the Check?

Good/proper method names are usually so meaningful, that the `RETURNING` parameter does not need a name of its own.  
The name would do little more than parrot the method name or repeat something obvious.

### How to solve the issue?

Calling the `RETURNING` parameter as `RESULT`.

### What to do in case of exception?

In exceptional cases, you can suppress this finding by using the pseudo comment `"#EC RET_NAME` which should be placed after the method declaration:

```abap
  METHODS get_name
    RETURNING
      VALUE(name) TYPE string. "#EC RET_NAME
```

### Example

Before the check:

```abap
  METHODS get_name
    RETURNING
      VALUE(name) TYPE string.
```

After the check:

```abap
  METHODS get_name
    RETURNING
      VALUE(result) TYPE string.
```
