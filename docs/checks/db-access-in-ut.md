## Database Access within Unit-Tests Check

### What is the Intent of the Check?

The “Database Access within Unit-Tests” Check scans test classes and its contents searching for any kind of explicit DB access within the tests. Since every DB access is considered to be a dependency, this should not be allowed in test code.

### How does the check work?

Statements like: SELECT, EXEC SQL, COMMIT, COMMIT WORK, ROLLBACK, INSERT, DELETE, ALTER; UPDATE or READ TABLE accessing physical database tables (SAP Dictionary Tables) are detected and presented.

### Which attributes can be maintained?

![Attributes](./imgs/database_access_in_ut.png)

### How to solve the issue?

The solution is to mock these DB accesses with a proper dependency isolation technique.

### What to do in case of exception?

In special cases, it is possible to suppress a finding by using the pseudo comment `"#EC DB_ACCESS_UT`.  
The pseudo comment must be placed right after the DB access statement.

### Example

```abap
SELECT XXXXX.       "#EC DB_ACCESS_UT
```
