## FORM Routine Usage Check

### What is the Intent of the Check?

`FORM` Routines are sub-routines in procedural programming. With the release of Object Oriented ABAP this syntax became obsolete.

### How does the check work?

This check searches for the usage of the `ENDFORM` statement.

### Which attributes can be maintained?

![Attributes](./imgs/form_routine_usage.png)

### How to solve the issue?

Use classes and methods instead. Methods are similar to subroutines and can be used for modularization.

### What to do in case of exception?

You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC CI_FORM`.  
The pseudo comment must be placed right after the `FORM` declaration.

```abap
FORM my_form. "#EC CI_FORM
  " Form content
ENDFORM.
```
