## External Call in Unit Tests-Check

### What is the Intent of the Check?

This check scans test classes and its contents searching for any kind of explicit redirection (external call changing the main workflow to another program) within test methods. Since every external call/redirection is considered to be a dependency, this should not be allowed in test code.

### How does the check work?

The check searches for statements which may lead to an external call or redirection (e.g.: `SUBMIT`) deviating the regular workflow (call stack) of a program to another program.
The check also searches for any Remote Calls (RFCs) as well as instances or usage of `CL_GUI_*` classes (these should also be avoid in Unit Tests).

### How to solve the issue?

The solution is either to remove or mock these external call/redirection with a proper dependency isolation technique.

### What to do in case of exception?

In exceptional cases, you can suppress this finding by using the pseudo comment `“#EC EXT_CALL_UT` which should be placed right after the statement itself:

```abap
SUBMIT program.       “#EC EXT_CALL_UT
```
