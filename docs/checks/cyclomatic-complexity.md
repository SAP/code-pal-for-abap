## Cyclomatic Complexity Check

### What is the Intent of the Check?

The Cyclomatic Complexity Check is part of the Clean Code Check Repository. The cyclomatic complexity measures the complexity of a program, a class, a form or a module and is based on the control flow graph. It is a count for the number of linearly-independent paths through the source code.

A high value in cyclomatic complexity is an indicator that the source code is not readable anymore in a way that maintaining and extending the code can be done efficiently. In addition, the risk of introducing bugs is higher in code with high cyclomatic complexity.

### How does the check work?

In this implementation, the number of binary decision points "b" (for example, IF-statements) is counted.

The cyclomatic complexity M = b + 1

### Which attributes can be maintained?

### How to solve the issue?

Modularize the functionality into smaller blocks. This reduces the cyclomatic complexity and increases the readability.

### What to do in case of exception?

You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC CI_CYCLO`.  
The pseudo comment must be placed after the `ENDMETHOD` statement.

#### Example

```abap
METHOD method_name.
  " Method content
ENDMETHOD. "#EC CI_CYCLO
```
