## Deprecated Classes

### What is the Intent of the Check?

It points out deprecated classes which should be replaced by newer objects.

You can check the list of supported objects in the `constructor` of the `y_check_deprecated_classes` class. 

### How does the check work?

This check searches for the usage of deprecated classes.

### How to solve the issue?

Use the newer objects instead.

### What to do in case of exception?

You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC DEPRECATED_CLAS`.  
The pseudo comment must be placed right after the statement.

Before the check:
```abap
DATA aunit TYPE REF TO cl_aunit_assert.
```

After the check:
```abap
DATA aunit TYPE REF TO cl_abap_unit_assert.
```
