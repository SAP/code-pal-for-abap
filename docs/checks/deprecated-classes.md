## Deprecated Classes

### What is the Intent of the Check?

This check points out deprecated classes which should be replaced by newer objects.

You can check the list of currently supported objects in the `constructor` of the `y_check_deprecated_classes` class. 

### How does the check work?

This check searches for the usage of deprecated classes. For instance:

```abap
DATA aunit TYPE REF TO cl_aunit_assert.
```

### How to solve the issue?

Reference non deprecated/newer objects instead. For the above example, a corrected code would look like:

```abap
DATA aunit TYPE REF TO cl_abap_unit_assert.
```

### What to do in case of exception?

In exceptional cases (e.g.: for keeping downport release compatibility), you can suppress this finding by using the pseudo comment `"#EC DEPRECATED_CLAS` which should be placed right after the statement:

```abap
DATA aunit TYPE REF TO cl_aunit_assert. "#EC DEPRECATED_CLAS` 
```
