### What is the Intent of the Check?

This check executes the ABAP Unit-Test framework and returns the current coverage percentile for the object in question. It verifies if the coverage is under the defined thresholds (customized in the checks).

> :WARNING: Use this check with a small set of objects only (due to possible performance issues).

### How to solve the issue?

Improve the Unit-Test coverage(s) by writing Unit-Tests.

### What to do in case of exception?

No exemptions are allowed.
