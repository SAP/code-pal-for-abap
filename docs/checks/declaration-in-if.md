## Declaration in IF Check

### What is the Intent of the Check?

The Declaration in IF check searches for declarative statements in optional structures as such statements can lead to confusion and issues during execution. ABAP's deepest scope is METHOD, so declarations inside an IF will be available outside the IF anyway.

### How does the check work?

This check searches for `DATA`, `TYPES` and `FIELD-SYMBOLS` in `IF` statements and `IF` branches.

### Which attributes can be maintained?

![Attributes](./imgs/declaration_in_if.png)

### How to solve the issue?

Remove or relocate the declarations.

### What to do in case of exception?

You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC DECL_IN_IF`.  
The pseudo comment must be placed right after the declaration.

```abap
IF example = ''.
  TYPES type_declaration TYPE string. "#EC DECL_IN_IF
  FIELD-SYMBOLS: <field_declaration> TYPE any. "#EC DECL_IN_IF
  DATA data_declaration TYPE string. "#EC DECL_IN_IF
ENDIF.
```
