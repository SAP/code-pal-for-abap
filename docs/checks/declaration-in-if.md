## Declaration in IF Check

### What is the Intent of the Check?

The Declaration in IF check searches for declarative statements in optional structures as such statements can lead to confusion and issues during execution.

### How does the check work?

This check searches for `DATA`, `TYPES` and `FIELD-SYMBOLS` in `IF` statements and `IF` branches.

### Which attributes can be maintained?

![Attributes](./imgs/declaration_in_if.png)

### How to solve the issue?

Remove or relocate the declarations.

### What to do in case of exception?

You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC DECL_IN_IF`.  
The pseudo comment must be placed right after the declaration.

```abap
IF example = ''.
  TYPE type_declaration TYPE string. "#EC DECL_IN_IF
  FIELD-SYMBOLS: <field_declaration> TYPE any. "#EC DECL_IN_IF
  DATA data_declaration TYPE string. "#EC DECL_IN_IF
ENDIF.
```
