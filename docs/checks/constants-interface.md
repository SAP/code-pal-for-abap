## Constants Interface Check

### What is the Intent of the Check?

You should always prefer enumeration classes to constants interfaces.

### How does the check work?

The check searches for interfaces with only constants.

### Which attributes can be maintained?

![Attributes](./imgs/constants_interface.png)

### How to solve the issue?

Use enumeration classes instead.

### What to do in case of exception?

In special cases, it is possible to suppress a finding by using the pseudo comment `"#EC CONS_INTF`.  
The pseudo comment must be placed right after the class definition header.

### Example

```abap
INTERFACE interface_name.   "#EC CONS_INTF
    CONSTANTS two TYPE i VALUE 2.
ENDINTERFACE.
```
