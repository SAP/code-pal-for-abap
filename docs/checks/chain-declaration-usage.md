## Chain Declaration Usage

### What is the Intent of the Check?

This check verifies the usage of chain up-front declarations.

### How to solve the issue?

Change the chain up-front declarations to inline declarations.

### What to do in case of exception?

In exceptional cases, you can suppress this finding by using the pseudo comment `"#EC CHAIN_DECL_USAG` which should be placed after the `DATA:` statement:

```abap
  DATA: "#EC CHAIN_DECL_USAG
    string TYPE string,
    json TYPE REF TO cl_abap_json,
    client LIKE sy-mandt.
```

### Example

Before the check:

```abap
  DATA:
    string TYPE string,
    json TYPE REF TO cl_abap_json,
    client LIKE sy-mandt.
```

After the check:

```abap
  DATA string TYPE string.
  DATA json TYPE REF TO cl_abap_json.
  DATA client LIKE sy-mandt.
```

Or even (which looks neat - but it won't be enforced):

```abap
DATA var1         TYPE a.
DATA var2         TYPE string.
DATA my_var3      TYPE int.
DATA a            TYPE c.
```
