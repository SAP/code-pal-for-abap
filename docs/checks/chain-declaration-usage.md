# Chain Declaration Usage
## What is the Intent of the Check?
The "Chain Declaration Usage" check verifies the usage of the chain up-front declarations. 

## How to solve the issue?
Change the chain up-front declarations to inline declarations.

## What to do in case of exception?
You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC CHAIN_DECL_USAG`. The pseudo comment has to be placed after the `DATA:` statement.

```abap
  DATA: "#EC CHAIN_DECL_USAG 
    string TYPE string, 
    json TYPE REF TO cl_abap_json,
    client LIKE sy-mandt.
```

## Example
Before the check: 
```abap
  DATA: 
    string TYPE string, 
    json TYPE REF TO cl_abap_json,
    client LIKE sy-mandt.
```

After the check:
```abap
  DATA string TYPE string.
  DATA json TYPE REF TO cl_abap_json.
  DATA client LIKE sy-mandt.
```
