## Maximum Nesting Depth Check

### What is the Intent of the Check?

The Maximum Nesting Depth is a count on the nesting level in a method, function module, form routine or module. A high value of nesting depth is an indicator that the source code is not readable anymore in a way that maintaining and extending the code can be done efficiently. In addition, the risk of introducing bugs is increased with a high nesting depth value.

### How does the check work?

The check taks the maximum number of nested code blocks within a method, function module, form routine or module.

`TEST-SEAM` statemetns do not add to the level of nesting depth.

### Which attributes can be maintained?

### How to solve the issue?

Modularize the functionality into smaller blocks. This increases the readability and efficiency.

### What to do in case of exception?

You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC CI_NESTING`.  
The pseudo comment must be placed right after the `ENDMETHOD` statement.

```abap
METHOD method_name.
  " Method content
ENDMETHOD. "#EC CI_NESTING
```
