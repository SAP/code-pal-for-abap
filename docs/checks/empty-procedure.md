## Empty Procedure Check

### What is the Intent of the Check?

The Empty Procedures check searches for empty methods, forms and modules.

### How does the check work?

The check highlights all empty code statements. Comments and Pragmas are also classified as "empty".

### Which attributes can be maintained?

![Attributes](./imgs/empty_procedure.png)

### How to solve the issue?

Remove the empty code blocks if they are not required/obsolete.

### What to do in case of exception?

You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC EMPTY_PROCEDURE`. The pseudo comment must be placed right after the `ENDMETHOD` statement.

```abap
METHOD method_name.

ENDMETHOD. "#EC EMPTY_PROCEDURE
```
