## READ TABLE with Subsequent Memory Assignment Check

### What is the Intent of the Check?

The "READ TABLE with Subsequent Memory Assignment" Check aims to prevent undesired changes to internal tables using field symbols in context of the `READ TABLE` statement with `INTO` instead of `ASSIGNING`.

### How does the check work?

This check finds `READ TABLE` statements which use statement `INTO` for assignment but using a field symbol instead of a variable.

### Which attributes can be maintained?

![Attributes](./imgs/read_table_subsequent_mem_assign.png)

### How to solve the issue?

Use `ASSIGNING` instead of `INTO` in combination with field symbols as otherwise the selected table row will be overwritten.

### What to do in case of exception?

You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC SUB_ASSIGN`.  
The pseudo comment must be placed after the closing dot of the `READ TABLE` statement.

```abap
READ TABLE itab ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>) WHERE key = '1'.
" Do something with <fs>

READ TABLE itab INTO <fs> WHERE key = '2'.    "#EC SUB_ASSIGN
" Do something with <fs>
```
