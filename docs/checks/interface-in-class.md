## Interface in Class Check

### What is the Intent of the Check?

The Is Interface in Class check searches for public methods without an interface.

### How does the check work?

This check counts only `DATA` and `CLASS-DATA` within a global or local, `CLASS DEFINITION` or `INTERFACE`. Inherited attributes and all constants are not counted. A structure is counted as one attribute, no matter how many attributes are in the structure.

### Which attributes can be maintained?

![Attributes](./imgs/interface_missing.png)

### How to solve the issue?

Make sure to implement an interface for the public methods.

### What to do in case of exception?

You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC INTF_IN_CLASS`.  
The pseudo comment must be placed right after the `PUBLIC SECTION` statement.

```abap
CLASS class_name DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION. "#EC INTF_IN_CLASS
ENDCLASS.
```
