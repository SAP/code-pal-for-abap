# Magic Number Check
## What is the Intent of the Check?
The Magic Number check searches for numbers which are present in the source code without being able to directly understand their meaning.

Using magic numbers has disadvantages:
* The code is not readable as you need to understand the meaning of the number again and again.
* If these numbers need to be changed, modifications are required in every place in the code where this number is present. This makes the maintenance of the code inefficient and error prone.

## How does the check work?
At the moment, the magic number check searches for numbers in the following statements only:
1. `IF`
2. `ELSEIF`
3. `WHEN`
4. `CHECK`
5. `DO`

For now, Magic Numbers associated with `SY-SUBRC` are not considered in this check. In addition, the numbers `0` and `1` are ignored.

## Which attributes can be maintained?

## How to solve the issue?
Create constants. By the name of the constants the number becomes a meaning which increases the readability. In addition, when maintaining the code, you only need to change the constant. This change can be done without the risk of introducing new errors or without forgetting some places where this change is required.

## What to do in case of exception?
You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC CI_MAGIC`. The pseudo comment must be placed right after the statement containing the magic number.

### Example
```abap
DO 5 TIMES. "#EC CI_MAGIC
  " Loop content
ENDDO.
```
