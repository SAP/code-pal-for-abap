# Method Return Bool Check
## What is the Intent of the Check?
This check aims for a meaningful name for methods, which return boolean values.

## How does the check work?
The check searches for methods with a boolean returning value and checks then, if the name starts with one of the following words:
* `is_`
* `has_`
* `are_`
* `try_`
* `can_`
* `have_`
* `starts_`
* `ends_`
* `must_`
* `should_`

or if the name contains one of the following words:
* `exist`
* `equal`
* `contain`

## Which attributes can be maintained?

## How to solve the issue?
Rename the method and start with is, has, are, have or contains.

## What to do in case of exception?
You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC METH_RET_BOOL`.

## Example
```abap
METHODS calc
    IMPORTING 
        number TYPE i
    RETURNING 
        VALUE(result) TYPE abap_bool.     "#EC METH_RET_BOOL
```
