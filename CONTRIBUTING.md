# Contributing

We are a small team and this project is one of many projects. We would love to see, when you help us developing new checks. Here a small how-to.

Fork our repository, then clone/pull the forked repo via ABAPgit into your system:

    https://github.com/your-username/code-pal-for-abap.git

Create and test your new Check in your system.

When you are done. Please `stage` --> `commit` --> `push` the files to your fork.

Back to github.com you can create a pull request from your fork to our base repo.

This is the point, where we'll look into your code and approve the merge. Please create the request to merge with our `dev` branch.
