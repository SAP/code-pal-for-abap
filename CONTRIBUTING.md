# Contributing

We are a team with limited capacity dedicated to several projects. Every single contribution is valid and more than welcome. Feel free to help us in developing new ABAP Checks and keeping this project up & running! Hereby a short how-to tutorial.

### How-to

Fork our repository, then clone/pull the forked repo via ABAPgit into your system:

    https://github.com/your-username/code-pal-for-abap.git

Create and test your new Check in your system.

When you are done. Please `stage` --> `commit` --> `push` the files to your fork.

Back to github.com you can create a pull request from your fork to our base repo.

This is the point, where we'll look into your code and approve the merge. Please create the request to merge with our `dev` branch, because our work-flow is from `dev` to `test` to `master`.

Thank you in advance for contributing and for sharing your ideas with the community!
