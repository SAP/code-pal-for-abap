## How to Configure

⚠️This documentation describes how to configure using the `Profile Management Tool` feature only.

💡Alternatively, you can use the SAP Code Inspector variants in the `SCI` transaction.

💡 The transaction `Y_CODE_PAL_PROFILE` provides access to the `Profile Management Tool`.

### Profiles

> Profiles are similar to Code Inspector Variants.

Behavior:

- (❗) If you assign a Profile to your user, **it overwrites the Code Inspector variant** (❗);
- If you assign multiple Profiles to your user, the tool will combine them in runtime;
- You can assign someone else Profile to your user;
- The Profile is deleted once it has no check and assigned to nobody.

To create or assign it, click on the `+` button, and inform the Profile name:

![create a profile](imgs/create-profile.png)

### Delegates

> Delegates are the Profile owners who are allowed to configure it;
> Multiple delegates are allowed.

Behavior:

- If you aren't a Delegate, you won't be able to add / change / remove a Delegate or Check.

To add someone else, click on the `+` button and inform his / her user name:

![assign delegate](imgs/assign-delegate.png)

### Checks

> Checks are the rules based on the [Clean ABAP](https://github.com/SAP/styleguides/blob/main/clean-abap/CleanABAP.md).

Behavior:

- You can define a Check threshold (if applicable);  
- You can define a Check severity / priority (error / priority 1, warning / priority 2, or notification / priority 3)
- You can define a Check filter on productive code, test code, or both (if applicable);
- You can define a Check filter on object creation date;
- You can define a Check validity period;
- You can define if a Check can/cannot be exempt via pseudo-comments (if applicable). 
- If you have multiple Profiles assigned to your user, the check with the"strongest" or "sharpest" thresholds will be taken;

To assign them to your Profile, click on the `+` button:

![assign check](imgs/assign-check.png)

![customize check](imgs/customize-check.png)

💡 You can use the documentation button to navigate to the Check documentation:
