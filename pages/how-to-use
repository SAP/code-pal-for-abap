When code pal is in your system, just go to Transaction `SCI` or `SCII` and execute the Checks with your prefered Thresholds. To have a consistent set of Checks and Thresholds you can always create a Code Inspector Variant.

To understand how the checks work, please refer to the [Check Documentation](/docs/check_documentation.md).

Then simply execute the Checks.

Note: You can simulate the checks using the `Y_DEMO_FAILURES` class.
