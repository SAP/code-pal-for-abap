# Code Pal for ABAP

[Code Pal for ABAP](../../README.md) > [How to Migrate](../how-to-migrate.md) > [From `v1.01.0` to `v1.02.0`](v1-01-0-to-v1-02-0.md)

## From `v1.01.0` to `v1.02.0`

It changed the folder logic. Therefore, we will have to reinstall the code pal for ABAP completely as abapGit is not able to perform this conversion.

### 1. Backup

If you have customized any check in the Code Inspector, we recommend you to take a note of them and reimplement them again after the re-installation (maybe, you can migrate to Profiles now).

If you have customized any check in the Profiles, no backup is required.  

If you are a contributor, you will have to move your new check or changed objects out of the code pal for ABAP package as we will have to delete everything.

### 2. Removing Global Check Variant

Start the transaction `SCI`, and remove the `Y_CLEAN_CODE` global check variant.  

### 3. Deactivate Code Inspector Checks and Category

Start the transaction `SCI`, and go to the `Code Inspector > Management of > Checks` menu.  
Then, deselect all the `Y_CHECK_*` entries and save it.
