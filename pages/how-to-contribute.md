# Contributing

We are a team with limited capacity dedicated to several projects. Every single contribution is valid and more than welcome. Feel free to help us in developing new ABAP Checks and keeping this project up & running! Hereby a short how-to tutorial.

### How-to

Fork our repository, then clone/pull the forked repo via ABAPgit into your system:

    https://github.com/your-username/code-pal-for-abap.git

Create and test your new Check in your system.

When you are done. Please `stage` --> `commit` --> `push` the files to your fork.

Back to github.com you can create a pull request from your fork to our base repo.

At this point of time, we will verify your code and authorize/approve the merge (if applicable). Please create the request to merge it with our `master` branch.

Thank you in advance for contributing and sharing your ideas within our community! We really appreciate this!
